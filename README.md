# Project Name: GameList Manager

## Overview

Welcome to the GameList Manager repository! This project utilizes Bootstrap 5 for the front-end design and incorporates JavaScript to dynamically modify a list of games stored in memory. The application allows users to view, add, edit, and delete games from the list, providing a seamless and responsive user interface.

## Features
